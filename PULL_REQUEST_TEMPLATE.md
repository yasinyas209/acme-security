## 🎯 Brief Summary (2-3 sentences)

Briefly describe your approach and key findings:

[My approach here was primarily based on the architecture. I started with email analysis, where I noticed phishing. Then, in the web logs, I noticed that access was gained and data was extracted through phishing using the SQL injection method. Later, I saw that stolen tokens were used to access the mobile application. In the API logs and WAF logs, I noticed WAF bypass.]

## 🔍 Key Findings Highlight

*Main attack vectors identified:*
1. SQL injection___________
2. Phishing_________
3. WAF Bypass___________

*Most critical vulnerability:*
__WAF Bypass_______

*Top recommendation:*
_Employees should be informed about phishing, WAF bypass vulnerabilities should be addressed, SQL commands should be modified, consecutive requests should not be allowed, and suspicious IP addresses should be blocked.________

## 💭 Challenges & Learnings

*What was most challenging?*
[The lack of precise information about the morning and evening within the time frame.]

*What did you learn?*
[I learned how carelessness on the part of an employee can lead to mistakes, and I learned how to establish a timeline and connections between events. ]

*What would you do differently?*
[First, I would give employees a seminar on safety. I would be stricter about the rules, block those who request too many transactions, and keep the team reactive.]
